# ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ HELP UKRAINE

I'm the creator of this project. 
My country, Ukraine, [is being invaded by the Russian Federation, right now](https://war.ukraine.ua). If you want to help my country to fight, consider donating to [charity supporting Ukrainian army](https://www.comebackalive.in.ua/). More options is described on [support ukraine](https://supportukrainenow.org/) site.

# dotty-cps-async


This is the implementation of async/await transformation for [Scala 3][scala3] (Dotty), based on an optimized version of [CPS] (*Continuation Passing Style*) transformation, where the continuation is â€˜pushedâ€™ to the monad. 

## <span id="highlights">Highlights</span>

 * Full support of all Scala language constructs in async/await block.
 * Pluggable monad interface:  
    *  An await monad can be any trait for which it is possible to implement [`CpsAsyncMonad`](https://github.com/rssh/dotty-cps-async/blob/master/shared/src/main/scala/cps/CpsMonad.scala) type class. You can provide those methods for your favorite monad.
 * Limited support of high-order functions:
    * ```urls.map(fetchData(_))(await _ )``` is an idiomatic way to fetch data for all items in parallel.
    * An application developer or library author can provide 'shifted' implementation of the own high-order functions.
 * Optional features, which enhance ergonomics in some cases, such as automatic coloring and handling discarded values
 * Optional [SIP-22 compatible API][sip_22].
